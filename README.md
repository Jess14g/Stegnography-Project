Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography
This project implements a steganography technique that allows secure data hiding within an image. It enables the concealment of confidential information such as text files, messages, 
or binary data in an image file, ensuring that the hidden data is not easily detectable by humans or algorithms.

The project focuses on security, efficiency, and robustness, leveraging common image processing techniques to embed and extract hidden data, while ensuring minimal alteration to the original image.
